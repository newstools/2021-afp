From January 2022, AFP will become a regular supplier of international video production for the prestigious German public television network ARD, one of Europe’s biggest audio-visual groups known for its daily news broadcast “Tagesschau”, rolling news channel tagesschau24 and website tagesschau.de. The two partners recently signed a multi-year contract, capping a cooperation that has developed in the video domain over the last years. Under the deal, ARD’s nine regional television chains in Germany will get access to all of AFPTV’s global production, including live broadcasts produced by an unrivalled network spanning 260 sites across 151 countries. The comprehensive production will also be accessible as part of a multi-year contract to the international and multilingual channel Deutsche Welle. “We are very proud of the confidence that a reputable group like ARD has placed in us through this long-term partnership. It is an immense recognition of the quality of our video coverage, as well as of the work on the ground by our teams covering major news events and the human stories that surround them in the four corners of the world,” said Juliette Hollier-Larousse, director of AFPTV. ARD, reputed for its high standards for content and quality of its news programmes, joins a long list of AFPTV clients across the world – including the BBC, RAI, Al-Jazeera and South Korean public television network KBS. AFP has also just received two major awards. For the second consecutive year, it has been named the best news agency at the 2021 AIB Awards (Association for International Broadcasting). Solan Kolli, our reporter in Ethiopia, won the prestigious Rory Peck Award in the news category for a report on the conflict in Tigre.
